        <div class="section-title">My Philosophy</div>
        <p>My career began in traditional computer science, optimizing backend systems. But I quickly discovered my true passion was at the intersection of logic and artistry—the frontend. I found that a millisecond delay or a slight design misalignment could ruin an entire user interaction.</p>

        <p>That is why I approach every project as an act of creation, not just assembly. We’re not building a website; we are crafting a digital presence that feels intuitive, responsive, and genuinely *exciting* to use. I combine the robust architecture of a software engineer with the eye of a designer.</p>

        <p>This holistic approach allows me to deliver solutions that are not only beautiful on the surface but are also scalable, maintainable, and highly optimized for modern web standards. I focus on technologies that push boundaries, such as React, GSAP for smooth animations, and Next.js for superior performance.</p>
