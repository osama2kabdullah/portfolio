        <div class="section-title">01. The Challenge</div>
        <h2>A Stagnant E-commerce Platform</h2>
        <p>
            Nexus Corp. operated a successful but aging e-commerce site built on a monolithic architecture. The system was slow, difficult to update, and required excessive resources for maintenance. Their primary goals were to improve site performance, enhance the mobile user experience, and create a scalable foundation for future growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key pain points identified through initial audits and stakeholder interviews were: average page load speed over 4 seconds, complex checkout process, and lack of integration with modern payment gateways. The existing codebase was heavily tangled, making bug fixes risky and feature development prohibitively slow.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
        <div class="section-title">02. My Solution</div>
        <h2>Strategic, Modular Replatforming</h2>
        <p>
            I proposed a phased replatforming strategy. We moved the frontend to a React-based single-page application (SPA), enabling fast, dynamic rendering. The backend was restructured into a set of microservices using Node.js and hosted on Google Cloud, allowing for independent scaling of different functionalities (e.g., inventory vs. payment processing).
        </p>
        <p>
            The checkout flow was streamlined, reducing the required steps from five to three. We integrated a headless CMS for marketing content, giving the Nexus team full control over promotions without requiring developer intervention. This decoupling of concerns drastically improved deployment speed and stability.

            “Alex completely transformed our outdated system. The site feels instantaneous, and for the first time in years, our team can deploy new features without fearing a system-wide crash. Highly recommend for complex modernization projects.”

    <div class="content-block">
        <div class="section-title">03. The Results & Impact</div>
        <h2>Measurable Performance Gains</h2>
        <p>
            The new architecture delivered immediate and measurable business impact:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Page Load Time:</strong> Reduced from 4.2 seconds to 2.5 seconds (40% improvement).</li>
                <li><strong>Conversion Rate:</strong> Increased by 15% within the first month post-launch due to the streamlined checkout.</li>
                <li><strong>Developer Productivity:</strong> Feature deployment time was reduced from an average of two weeks to three days.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The platform successfully handled peak holiday traffic without incident, a major risk with the previous system.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The project was delivered on time and under budget, setting Nexus Corp. up for a successful future in e-commerce.
